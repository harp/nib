# Harp/Nib

Nib is a small and powerful library for the Stylus CSS language, providing robust cross-browser CSS3 mixins. This component makes it even easier to use with [Harp](http://harpjs.com), the static web server with built-in preprocessing.

## Install

After [installing Harp](http://harpjs.com/docs/environment/install), install Nib in your CSS directory:

```bash
harp install nib css
```

## Example

Now, reference the Nib and the included Iconic in your main Stylus file as you would normally.

```styl
@import "nib";
@import "iconic";
```
